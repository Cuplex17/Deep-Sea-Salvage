# Deep-Sea-Salvage

Pack Description:
Lore: You wake up to find that you have crashed. 
But...you're underwater! Your emergency eject pod is laying nearby and there is a weird blue structure nearby as well. 
You decide to clamber back into your pod for air...

Description: Stranded on a completely oceanic world, you must do whatever it takes to survive and eventually find a way to escape. 
Exploring huge caverns underneath for ores and scavenging what you can from ruins deserted by the previous inhabitants of this world. 
You must find a way to escape to a more habitable planet hopefully in one piece. 
This pack offers slightly similar gameplay to 1.13 vanilla (such as coral, kelp, flooded caves and fish) as well as a quest line to guide players. 
This pack isn't for the faint of heart, you can easily get lost exploring ruins and the large caverns or even running out of air while doing so!
