"# Deep-Sea-Salvage Changelog" 

v0.2.0:
Changes:
Remmoved:
- Random Things. Useless since I have removed some structures that needed it. It is also not helping with the restricted usage. 
- Enchiridion. Replaced with something better.

Added:
- Cooking for Blockheads. Forgot to add that last time. 
- Just Enough Harvestcraft. JEI integration for Pam's Harvestcraft. 
- Immersive Cables. Adding some more customisation with Applied Energistics. Now you can make it fit into your Immersive Engineering builds.
- Lilliputian. Configuring mob sizes. Gigantic deep sea squids. 
- LootTweaker. Allows me to change loot tables.
- Patchouli. Replacement of Enchiridion with more control.

Configuration Changes:
- More recipes converted to A.W
- Most helmets will be automatically enchanted with Aqua Affinity upon crafting. This is to make it easier to explore early on.
- Market only has a limited stock now. You are encouraged to find other ways to obtain farm animals.
- Fixed the typo in scripts. Fixed for issues(s) #3

v0.1.1:
Configuration Changes:
- Deleted the script that replaces all broken underwater blocks with water sources.
  It was creating issues such as not being able to play underwater. Fixed for issue(s) #1, #2
- Added crafting recipes for all artisan worktables.
- Added crafting recipes for all artisan worktable tools.
- Converted more normal crafting recipes to artisan worktables. More will come in the future. 

Tip: for those people wandering about how to survive the early game by feeding the Bubbell, 5 sunshine / moonlight lillies should
do the job. They are passive flowers so they decay so it's best to automate them as quick as you can.

I am currently very busy with life. Please report problems you find with each update on Github and I will try to fix them. 

v0.1.0:
MORE WORLD GEN COMING SOON. THIS VERSION IS NOT FOR EXTENDED PLAY.
YOU WILL NEED A WORLD RESET. I APOLOGISE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE CAUSED.

Changes:

Removed:
- Removed Aqua Creepers. They were too difficult to avoid and too hard of a mob to fight.
- Removed No Caves. This will make creating new worlds and loading chunks much quicker. However, this will mean that small caves with air will generate.
But it will be highly unlikely players can come across this.
- Removed Wooden Buckets. Where completely useless. 
- Removed TrashSlot. Quark has its own one.

Added:
- Added Lost Cities to generation. This will be the simple and first tier exploration structures.
- Added Pam's Harvestcraft. More foods, this will be made necessary in a few lines.
- Added Nutrition. Now you need to worry about food (only slightly though).
- Added Tough as Nails. Spicing up the early game.
- Added Tough Expansion. Providing easy survivability late game.
- Added Tidy Chunk. For removing most of those item entities that float during world generation. Should decrease lag.
- Added Enchiridion. For a in game wiki....sorta...
- Added Incorporeal. Expanding the botania storage system. 
- Added Artisan Worktables. Vanilla crafting table is now more mid-end game tier. Don't worry, you can still use auto crafting methods like
  the crafty crate. NOT ALL RECIPES ADDED YET. THIS IS JUST A TEST.

Configuration Changes:
- Deleted some unecessary config files
- Fixed biome tweaker scripts: removed errors, changed colour of water.
- Smelting ores in a Better With Mods kiln now yields double.
- Chopping logs using a Better With Mods saw now yields 8.
- Sifting sand now yields coral.
- Fisherman strainer now has all the aquaculture fishes.
- The script for recipes for botania flowers have been tweaked. No longer removes original recipe, instead just adds the new ones.
- When a block is broken, if there is water next to it, it will instantly fill that broken block space with water.
- You can no longer place certain blocks underwater such as torches, ladders, doors etc. This is to stop the cheaty air pockets created by those blocks / items. 
- Buffed Lanolin...again...

v0.0.7:
Changes:
- Davinci's Vessels. Submarines only. Steam engine must be attached. 
Allowed blocks are: Steel Blocks, slab, fence, sheet metal (all from Immersive Engineering), structural glass (from mekanism), lit redstone lamp (from quark) and vault / blast door (from malisis doors).
- Removed World Edit. Sorry, forgot to remove it after building structures...

v0.0.6:
Changes:
- Changed early game ore processing method. You can now use grills to smelt ores now. Planning to add ore doubling through BWM Kilns. 
- Added wand of the forest to starting chest. 
- Buffed the daybloom and the nightshade so they can actually sustain your life underwater early game. No more sudden drowning!
- Buffed the lanolin effective time. 
- Increased the amount of lanolin gained per smelt. 
More changes coming soonâ„¢

v0.0.5:
- Initial Release
