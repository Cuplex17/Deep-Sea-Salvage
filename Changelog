"# Deep-Sea-Salvage Changelog" 

v0.0.8:

YOU WILL NEED A WORLD RESET. I APOLOGISE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE CAUSED.

Changes:
- Removed Aqua Creepers. They were too difficult to avoid and too hard of a mob to fight.
- Removed No Caves. This will make creating new worlds and loading chunks much quicker. However, this will mean that small caves with air will generate.
But it will be highly unlikely players can come across this. 
- Deleted some unecessary config files
- Fixed biome tweaker scripts: removed errors, changed colour of water. 
- Added Pretty Beaches. Works on some occasions but mainly added to stop the weirdness of underwater broken blocks.
- Added The Fauna Amplications. This adds sharks, piranhas, penguins etc.
- Added Lost Cities to generation. This will be the simple and first tier exploration structures.
- Added Additional Loot Tables. This allows me to customise loot tables easily.

v0.0.7:
Changes:
- Davinci's Vessels. Submarines only. Steam engine must be attached. Allowed blocks are: Steel Blocks, slab, fence, sheet metal (all from Immersive Engineering), structural glass (from mekanism), lit redstone lamp (from quark) and vault / blast door (from malisis doors).

- Removed World Edit. Sorry, forgot to remove it after building structures...

v0.0.6:
Changes:
- Changed early game ore processing method. You can now use grills to smelt ores now. Planning to add ore doubling through BWM Kilns. 

- Added wand of the forest to starting chest. 

- Buffed the daybloom and the nightshade so they can actually sustain your life underwater early game. No more sudden drowning!

- Buffed the lanolin effective time. 

- Increased the amount of lanolin gained per smelt. 

More changes coming soonâ„¢

v0.0.5:
