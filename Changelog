"# Deep-Sea-Salvage Changelog" 

v0.0.8:

YOU WILL NEED A WORLD RESET. I APOLOGISE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE CAUSED.

Changes:
- Removed Aqua Creepers. They were too difficult to avoid and too hard of a mob to fight.
- Deleted some unecessary config files
- Fixed biome tweaker scripts: removed errors, changed colour of water. 
- Added Pretty Beaches. Works on some occasions but mainly added to stop the weirdness of underwater broken blocks.
- Added Lost Cities to generation. This will replace most if not all other structures. 

v0.0.7:
Changes:
- Davinci's Vessels. Submarines only. Steam engine must be attached. Allowed blocks are: Steel Blocks, slab, fence, sheet metal (all from Immersive Engineering), structural glass (from mekanism), lit redstone lamp (from quark) and vault / blast door (from malisis doors).

- Removed World Edit. Sorry, forgot to remove it after building structures...

Changes:
- Changed early game ore processing method. You can now use grills to smelt ores now. Planning to add ore doubling through BWM Kilns. 

- Added wand of the forest to starting chest.
