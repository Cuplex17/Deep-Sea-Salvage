"# Deep-Sea-Salvage Changelog" 

v0.1.0:

YOU WILL NEED A WORLD RESET. I APOLOGISE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE CAUSED.

Changes:
- Removed Aqua Creepers. They were too difficult to avoid and too hard of a mob to fight.
- Removed No Caves. This will make creating new worlds and loading chunks much quicker. However, this will mean that small caves with air will generate.
But it will be highly unlikely players can come across this. 
- Deleted some unecessary config files
- Fixed biome tweaker scripts: removed errors, changed colour of water.
- The script for recipes for botania flowers have been tweaked. No longer removes original recipe, instead just adds the new ones.
- When a block is broken, if there is water next to it, it will instantly fill that broken block space with water.
- Buffed Lanolin...again...
- Added Mo' Creatures. Adding more life to the ocean. 
- Added Lost Cities to generation. This will be the simple and first tier exploration structures.
- Added Additional Loot Tables. This allows me to customise loot tables easily.
- Added Pam's Harvestcraft. More foods, this will be made necessary in a few lines.
- Added Harvestables. Easier farming.
- Added Nutrition. Now you need to worry about food (only slightly though).
- Added Tough as Nails. Spicing up the early game.
- Added Tough Expansion. Providing easy survivability late game.
- Added Tidy Chunk. For removing most of those item entities that float during world generation. Should decrease lag.
- Added Enchiridion. For a in game wiki....sorta...

Allowed blocks are: Steel Blocks, slab, fence, sheet metal (all from Immersive Engineering), structural glass (from mekanism), lit redstone lamp (from quark) and vault / blast door (from malisis doors).

Changes:
- Changed early game ore processing method. You can now use grills to smelt ores now. Planning to add ore doubling through BWM Kilns. 
- Added wand of the forest to starting chest. 
- Buffed the daybloom and the nightshade so they can actually sustain your life underwater early game. No more sudden drowning!
